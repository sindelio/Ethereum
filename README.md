# Smart Contracts

In smart_contract_samples there's a collection of useful Ethereum smart contracts written in Solidity.

1. ERC20.sol - Standard token smart contract.
2. SimpleContract.sol - Basic smart contract for test purposes.
2. Ownership.sol - Ownership smart contract. Used to ascertain ownership before executing functions.
3. FaultTolerance.sol - Fault tolerance smart contract. Used to to freeze accounts if there are any problems.
4. ProofOfExistence.sol - Smart contract that gives proof of existence to a document. used to create SHA hashes from input strings and store them into the Ethereum Blockchain.
5. Deadline.sol - Deadline smart contract. Used to ascertain the expiration of a deadline before executing functions.
6. Crowdsale.sol - Crowdsale smart contract. Used to raise funds for a project.

In truffle_test there's a test for compiling, deploying and testing smart contracts locally with Truffle and testRPC.

In web3_test there's a test for creating cliente-side applications that can interact with Ethereum based blockchains.
Web3.js is the official Javascript library for Ethereum.

And there's also solidity_notes.txt, my personal study notes so far about Solidity, smart contracts and the Ethereum platform.
