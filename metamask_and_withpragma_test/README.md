# ABOUT METAMASK AND WITHPRAGMA

Metamask is a web browser extension/plugin that allows a browser to interact with blockchain applications, such as payments. It has a built in wallet for Ethereum and Ethereum based tokens. It also has a deployer that can be called by online applications. The interesting thing about Metamask is that it does not require any sync with the Ethereum blockchain in order to deploy smart contracts.
Withpragma is an online IDE to write smart contracts in Solidity for the Ethereum platform. It has a compiler and can call the Metamask smart contract deployer. 

# HOW TO USE THIS METAMASK AND WITHPRAGMA TEST

### Step -1: Install the Metamask browser extension/plugin, create an account and login.

### Step 0: Browse to **https://www.withpragma.com/**, create an account and login.

### Step 1: Go to the editor in **https://www.withpragma.com/editor**.

### Step 2: Compile the smart contract code in the latest version of the Solidity compiler (0.4.21 in the moment this was written).

### Step 3: Deploy the smart contract on the Rinkeby testnet or the Ethereum livenet. A popup from Metamask will appear asking for permission to execute the transaction. The transaction will have a cost in Gas, and it will be possible to accept the transaction if there are enough funds. That's pretty much it.
